    <title>Working Experience</title>
    <para>
      I've been working in the field of Information Technologies for
      more than 22 years, starting from basic support activities for
      end users until getting into very complex activities like the
      planning and execution of projects for mission-critical
      tasks. I also have had the opportunity to teach, which is a
      great enriching experience.
    </para>
    <para>
      My comfort zone is in around the FreeBSD project, which provides
      an excellent OS, documentation and development ecosystem;
      accompanied by an excellent community of hackers. I also was
      very savvy in the Linux world some years ago; however, the some
      changes introduced a few years ago into the main distributions
      have disappointed me a lot. This is a matter of preference,
      though, I can work on any Unix-like environment.
    </para>
    <para>
      My orientation has always been into what happens in the
      backstage (Infrastructure/Architecture) instead of the
      scenarios (User Experience/Interfaces), closely related to
      development cycles (DevOps). That's true even before this
      terminology came to existence.
    </para>
    <para>
      My working experience can be splitted in two: projects
      executed as freelance consultant and positions occupied in some
      companies.

	    Venelectronics is a retail store with 5 branches in
	    Venezuela. There are many challeneges associated to the
	    politics, taxes and laws in Venezuela, making it harder to
	    run a retail store and spacially in the ecommerce world.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    I have been in charge of the execution of small projects
	    for the customization of their CRM software, trying to
	    align it with the products and promotions launched by the
	    Marketing Department and others.

	    My main tasks are to provide the physical space, services,

	    non-technical assessments.

	  A webservice was developed, implementing the serial protocol
	  and making it available via HTTP. The solution was written
	  in Perl on Debian Linux, and embedded in a VirtualBox image,
	  so it can be run inside a Windows server.

	  <subtitle>Bayco, C.A.</subtitle>
	  <para>
	    Bayco is a security solutions provider for the banking
	    industry in Venezuela. They lost the control over a
	    product they owned, due to some discordance with the
	    former developers of the product. I was able to
	    reverse-engineering the product and implement it using
	    open source technologies. I gave them back the control
	    over the product by writing detailed documentation about
	    how their product works, how was developed and how can be
	    modified.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The rewrite was made with Perl, using the framework
	    Mojolicious, PortgreSQL and Debian Linux. A customization
	    of the debian-installer was made in order to include the
	    corporate image of Bayco. The functionality of the
	    product was to take a screenshot of face, check and id
	    document when a client goes to the bank to cash a check.

	  <subtitle>FIDES, C.A.</subtitle>
	  <para>
	    FIDES is a company providing medical services through a
	    call center. The requirement was a setup such that if the
	    main VoIP PBX server fails, the spare can't take more than
	    20 seconds for the failover.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The goal was achieved combining specialized hardware from
	    <trademark>Digium</trademark> and replication techniques
	    on Elastix.

	  <title>Load Balancing Cluster</title>
	  <subtitle>inmobilia.com</subtitle>
	  <para><emphasis>inmobilia.com</emphasis> is a real state web
	  portal with presence in 13 countries. The initial setup for
	  their portal went out of capacity when they reached 4 hits
	  per second. I designed for them a mixed cluster with virtual
	  and bare metal servers, with defined roles as
	  <foreignphrase>loadbalancers</foreignphrase>,
	  <foreignphrase>backends</foreignphrase> and
	  <foreignphrase>databases</foreignphrase>. I also leaded the
	  development team into the <emphasis>Git Branching
	  Model</emphasis> workflow, documented in <ulink
	  url="http://http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">this
	  article by Vincent Driessen</ulink>. Finally, I configured
	  an Amazon S3 bucket for the bank of images of the portal
	  (about 160 GB by that time) and helped to integrate the
	  storage service in the portal.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    The performance increased drastically, holding loads of
	    above 30 requests per second with no significant impact on
	    the servers, whose could handle up to 5 times such load
	    without penalties. This implementation is saving money by
	    using virtual servers for most of the hosts and not
	    requiring huge amounts of additional storage for backups.

	  <title>Recovery of files from <trademark>Glacier</trademark></title>
	  <subtitle>inmobilia.com</subtitle>
	  <para>
	    The development team of inmobilia.com tried to implement
	    the versioning feature from S3 service. However, they made
	    a mistake and sent all their images to Glacier, where they
	    are not available online. Even with paid support from AWS,
	    they were unable to recover the files.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Using the API from AWS S3 I wrote I script in Perl making
	    parallel request, which helped to recover the files 16
	    times faster than the time required if we used the methods
	    suggested by AWS support. You can take a look at the
	    script at https://github.com/granalberto/s3mu.
